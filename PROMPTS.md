# Prompts Used During Development

Throughout the creation and evolution of this project, the following prompts were
submitted to an AI programming assistant.  The responses (not shown) guided code
changes, bug fixes, and feature additions.

1. **Error debugging**
   - "index.html:397 POST http://localhost:8080/watchlist 500 (Internal Server Error)... solve this error"

2. **Feature requests and bug fixes**
   - "now whwn i click mark as watched it is showing failed"
   - "and the rating and add more details from the movie"
   - "remove the word bollywood from frontend make it cinema and adjust the styling of it"
   - "can you make the frontend dark cinematic theme"
   - "can u add a button where i can remove movie from my watchlist?"
   - "add user database"

3. **Documentation request**
   - "Database schema for user data and cached movies README with API documentation and external API setup Document explaining your caching strategy update readme according to this neatly and A README.md file explaining the design and implementation A markdown design document (if separate from README) All prompts used (if any AI tools were used to generate the code) all these should be included"

These prompts may represent simplified or paraphrased versions of the conversation,
but they capture the high-level intent that drove each round of development.

*Note:* the AI also generated numerous intermediate suggestions and code edits in
response to each prompt; those are preserved implicitly in the repository's history.
