# Prompts Used During Development
Throughout the creation and evolution of this project, the following prompts were
submitted to an AI programming assistant.  The responses (not shown) guided code
changes, bug fixes, and feature additions.
1. Backend Error Debugging
“Resolve the 500 Internal Server Error occurring during the POST request to /watchlist and identify the root cause.”
2. Watchlist Feature Improvements
“Fix the ‘Mark as Watched’ functionality, add support for user ratings, and allow users to remove movies from their watchlist.”
3. User Management Integration
“Design and integrate a user database with appropriate schema and relationships to support authentication and watchlist functionality.”
4. UI/UX Enhancement
“Redesign the frontend with a dark cinematic theme, for a more professional presentation.”
5. Documentation & Architecture
“Prepare a comprehensive README including API documentation, database schema, caching strategy explanation, system design overview, and a record of AI-assisted prompts used during development.”
*Note:* the AI also generated numerous intermediate suggestions and code edits in
response to each prompt; those are preserved implicitly in the repository's history.
